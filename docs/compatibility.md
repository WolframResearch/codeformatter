# Compatibility


## Source Compatibility

CodeFormatter has source compatibility with 11.0+


## FrontEnd Compatibility

Any source .wl files that have `(* ::Package::"Tags" *)` or `(* ::Code::Initialization::"Tags" *)` syntax may only be edited with a version 12.3+ FE 


## WolframVersion

WolframVersion in PacletInfo is 12.1+ to maintain the same minimum required version as CodeParser


## Earlier Versions

Manually modify WolframVersion in PacletInfo.wl to allow the paclet to be used.

The message that you get when you install the paclet:
```
The paclet CodeParser was successfully installed.
```
does not necessarily mean that the paclet can be used.

Make sure that the correct WolframVersion is specified.
