# indent

## "rendering" phase at the end of IndentCST

There are some symbolic forms that are generated by IndentCST


```
IndentationNode[Block, ...]
```

Insert lines[]s before and after children, with proper indentation

Children are in their own "block"

For example, if you wanted to get:
```
{
    a;
    b;
    c
}
```
then the symbolic form would be:
```
{
    LeafNode["{"],
    IndentationNode[Block, {
        a;b;c
    }],
    LeafNode["}"]
}
```





```
IndentationNode[Increment, ...]
```

Increment indentation of children



```
line[]
```

A newline followed by indentation
