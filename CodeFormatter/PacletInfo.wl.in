  CodeFormatter has source compatibility with 11.0+, but various
  backward-compatibility issues prevent building with newer versions
  and running on old versions.

  It is recommended to build with the version that you will be

    It's my understanding that adding Prepend -> True to the FE extension causes the PacletManager to insert those paths before the ParentList in the default setting.
    That's exactly the right thing to do if your paclet might be both in the layout and in other paclet locations.
